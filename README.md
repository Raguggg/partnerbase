I am writing to express my interest in the web scraping task you have posted. I have reviewed the video provided ([watch video](https://www.veed.io/view/9c5b4b67-a357-4050-8675-0e09bb79a089?panel=quality-survey)) and have examined the script and sample output from the Google Drive folder ([view script and sample output](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hJ1hLjiWyxYz3bgynYhcp2K9_Phlzp3I)). I am confident that I can deliver the required script and output files promptly and efficiently.

I have extensive experience in web scraping and data extraction, with a proven track record of delivering high-quality results. I understand the importance of speed and efficiency in scraping tasks. Notably, I have noticed that the code provided utilizes Selenium, which can be relatively slow. In response, I have developed a rough code that significantly improves scraping speed. This code can scrape all companies on the first page within 5 minutes, achieving a rate of up to 20,000 companies in the same timeframe.

For your review, I have attached my code and the corresponding scraped data. You will find that it is optimized for performance and accuracy, ensuring that the task is completed well within your expected time frame.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to work on this project and am confident that my skills and experience make me a perfect fit for your requirements. If awarded the job, I will ensure that the script and output files meet your specifications and are delivered promptly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with you.
